A simple JS multiplayer game I made for practicing real-time server-client architecture.
I tried to do it intuitively -- if I would actually develop a game, I would use a suitable framework of course.
I just find that having low-level experience makes it easier to work with frameworks when you know what the
underlying problems might be.
